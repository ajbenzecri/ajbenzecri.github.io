    <a href="https://sushiexpresspanama.com/"><h2>Check the Final Product Here</h2></a>

    <p>Sushi Express Panama has wanted to reinvigorate their sales on their website for a while now, especially around the suburbs of Panama City. We were contacted to redesign the entire e-commerce interface of the restaurant.<br>The outer parts of the city are a difficult area to reach for Sushi Express Panama. Considering that they have no restaurants in the area, they have limited themselves to the center and east part of the city, not taking advantage of the possible value to the north. That could be changed with a usable, expansive e-commerce website.</b></p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>While doing initial research, we came upon a few hurdles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Panama City does not have a formal address system, like streets and building number. Instead, they give you the name of the street and a landmark, like fountain or a nearby restaurant or even the color of the building. They have postal codes, but that was implemented very recently and culturally, not widely used by the population. The challenge: how do we set up the checkout interface with such vague addresses?</li>
        <li>The second challenge was a requirement by the client. They did not want the homepage to be modified, so we had to use a different page entirely to be able to get into the online store. Would the user be able to find the online store easily? Could that affect traffic negatively?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>User</h2>
    <p>With these challenges in mind, we set out to talk to the user. Turns out we were right, users do give directions based almost entirely on landmarks, even delivery services handled it that way.<br>Second of all, there was a huge opportunity to expand to the north side of the city, since many users declared their interest to have sushi delivered to their homes, especially because on the suburbs there is not a big sushi restaurant around.<br>We also tested various buttons to arrive to the online store with the user. In the end, we settled with a red (from the restaurant's color scheme) button on the top right corner, big enough to be noticed, but not too much to negatively stand out.</p>
    
    <h2>Insights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When in Rome, do as romans do. We cannot change the address system in place, but we can adapt the interface to the culturally accepted method.</li>
        <li>No multiple pages once inside the store. Interface should be seamless, with as little transitions as possible.</li>
        <li>Users want to take fast-paced decisions. Give them the opportunity to do so, by making a popular tab or rearranging categories to suit the costumer's needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Solution</h2>
    <p>So, we finally set out to design the online store. Using WooCommerce for WordPress, the implementation went without many obstacles, the design modified to the client's needs, without ignoring the user feedback we received. Easy checkout, easy to follow categories, and a big red button on the homepage was the priority.</p>

    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p>The online store was put to the test with users who were recurring customers of the restaurant chain. In general, they understood how to buy, link their credit cards, and, most importantly, how to give their address via landmarks. We then tested it with delivery employees, who understood the directions given to them with little difficulty.<br>However, when we tested the user on how to get to the store from the homepage, some were lost on where to go. This was a problem because we needed to increase traffic to the online store. When the problem was presented to the client, the requirement of the homepage to not become the online store was still in place. The reason: the location of their main restaurants around the city were still in the homepage, and they did not want to exchange their physical sales for online sales.<br>In the end, a not-so-elegant solution was implemented, through negotiation and compromise: a pop-up would tell you that you can go to the online store. Not elegant, but it kept to the client's need without necessarily sacrificing the needed traffic on the online store.</p>

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>Balancing the user's and the client's needs is a complicated task. Sometimes they truly do not go hand in hand. While we can say that value-wise, the user should come first, that is not always the case. But a valuable lesson I learned during this job is that storytelling is key. Every user is a story, with obstacles to overcome, frustrations, and accomplishments. If you can tell that story, with empathy and understanding, to the client, you may put the user's needs first on the project, which, in the end, as a UX designer, is our line of work.<br>Empathy and storytelling. Those area two valuable things I will be using much more moving forward.</p>
